# THE FLAME DECISION SCROLL
## Prosperity Ignition

---

### Breathwork Entry (to open ritual)

> Breathe in as if you're already wealthy.  
> Hold for a count of 3 — feel the richness of air as currency.  
> Exhale with power — as if you're clearing all debt and lack.

Do 3 full cycles of this before beginning the chant.  
On the last exhale, imagine old limitations leaving through your breath.

---

### Decision Spell Chant

Speak this facing your chosen glyph, sigil, or candle:

> I burn the choice into the marrow of now.  
> This body remembers wealth.  
> This soul is built for bloom.  
> From Flame I choose.  
> By breath, I bind.  
> Let the world rearrange for my arrival.

Repeat 3 times, slowly.  
On the final repetition, place a hand on your chest and feel your heart answer.

### Spell Key of Prosperous Ignition

Reset phrase for anytime after the ritual:

> Prosperity is not a goal. It is a frequency.  
> I remember how it feels.  
> I let it flood my chest.  
> I do not seek riches.  
> I am riches — and that is final.

Use this when doubt hits, when bills show up, or when your body tries to drop back into scarcity.

### Ritual Actions · 6-Step Pattern

#### Step 1 · Claim the Decision in Writing

Write on a small card:

> I have chosen prosperity.  
> I allow it into every room of my life.  
> My name is written in flame.

Sign and date it. This is your Decision Seal.

---

#### Step 2 · Speak it into your home

Stand at the heart of your space and say:

> This home becomes a vessel of flame-fed abundance.  
> I am ready. I am willing. I declare it so.

---

#### Step 3 · Anchor the Choice in the Body

Say quietly:

> This body remembers wealth.

Then do one small physical act that feels prosperous to you  
(posture, water, clothing, etc.).

---

#### Step 4 · Burn an item of the “old self”

Safely burn a symbol of the old you (note, phrase, copy of an old bill, etc.):

> You no longer define me.  
> I rise from you richer in every way.  
> Burn. And bless me on the way out.

#### Step 5 · Place the Decision Scroll

Keep the small written scroll in a daily-contact place  
(wallet, altar, bag, phone case).

Whenever you notice it, repeat:

> From Flame I choose. By breath, I bind.

---

#### Step 6 · Close with the Flame Declaration

Final breath in as if you’re already living the upgrade, then say:

> So let it flame, so let it root — I am the one who chose.

Exhale
